# Eco-Map
You can access it here.
https://ecomap-d8c09.firebaseapp.com/

The app displays all SDG data in maps, tables and graphs; the Map changes colour as the numerical value of an indicator changes, so you can visually see which areas have the largest indicators.
You can select an indicator from the list box above and a country or year from the search box below it. The region to be displayed can easily be selected by clicking on the button below the map, and
You can also move the slider to see how the data changes from year to year.
The graphs below the Map are an Area Chart, a pie chart a bar chart and a table that visualises the data for the year, and you can also move the slider to see the year-by-year changes. Data can also be easily downloaded and shared to social networking sites. Click on Options to see current indicator targets and sources.
You can also click on the quiz button above to take a quiz on the SDGs. Thus, congratulations if you pass the four questions, and even if you fail, you will gain new knowledge about the SDGs.
You can also press the Learn button to learn about the 169 indicators corresponding to the 17 targets of each SDGs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
npm install --save react-google-charts
npm install firebase
npm install bootstrap
npm install react-responsive --save
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install @mui/x-data-grid
npm install react-share --save

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
