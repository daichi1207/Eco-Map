The app displays all SDG data in maps, tables and graphs; the Map changes colour as the numerical value of an indicator changes, so you can visually see which areas have the largest indicators.
You can select an indicator from the list box above and a country or year from the search box below it. The region to be displayed can easily be selected by clicking on the button below the map, and
You can also move the slider to see how the data changes from year to year.
The graphs below the Map are an Area Chart, a pie chart a bar chart and a table that visualises the data for the year, and you can also move the slider to see the year-by-year changes. Data can also be easily downloaded and shared to social networking sites. Click on Options to see current indicator targets and sources.
You can also click on the quiz button above to take a quiz on the SDGs. Thus, congratulations if you pass the four questions, and even if you fail, you will gain new knowledge about the SDGs.
You can also press the Learn button to learn about the 169 indicators corresponding to the 17 targets of each SDGs.
